Here, the Order Date is completely messy. 
Let's clean that first.

Formatting dates in MySQL is quite straightforward. 
We can use the DATE_FORMAT() function to format dates in various styles.
			--------------------------
			 DATE_FORMAT(date, format)
			--------------------------
Common Date Formats: 
	- YYYY-MM-DD ('%Y-%m-%d')
	- DD/MM/YYYY ('%d/%m/%Y')
	- Month Day, Year ('%M %d, %Y')
    - Day of Week, Day Month Year ('%W, %d %M %Y')
    
Here, we have to clean and standardize the ORDER_DATE, 
as the formats are MM/DD/YYYY HH:MI and MM-DD-YYYY HH:MI now.
So, let's first create a new column to store the cleaned dates.
